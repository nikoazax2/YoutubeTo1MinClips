# YoutubeTo1MinClips

**YoutubeTo1MinClips** is a tool that downloads a YouTube video, splits it into clips of up to 1 minute, and crops the videos to portrait format (1080×1920) **or adds blurred sidebars in landscape** with audio.
Everything is done locally, with no global dependencies, thanks to `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` included in the project.

➡️ The goal is to make it easy to create short clips for TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts from YouTube videos.

## Installation

1. Download the project ZIP here: [YoutubeTo1MinClips.zip](https://github.com/nikoazax2/YoutubeTo1MinClips/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Extract the archive to a folder of your choice
3. Run the `maindl.exe` executable

That's it! The software will automatically download the required binaries (`yt-dlp.exe` and `ffmpeg.exe`) if they are not already present in the folder.

## Features

- Downloads a YouTube video in `.mp4` format
- Cuts the video between two specified timecodes (start and end)
- Generates several clips of up to 1 minute each
- **Two video cropping modes:**
  - **Portrait 9:16 (1080×1920)**
  - **Landscape with blurred sidebars (blur fill)** to keep the full image without cropping
- Keeps the audio
- Works with a Node.js script or a Windows `.exe` without Node installed

## Project Structure

```
YoutubeTo1MinClips/
├── maindl.js # Interactive Node.js script
├── yt-dlp.exe # yt-dlp binary (Windows)
├── ffmpeg.exe # ffmpeg binary (Windows)
├── maindl.exe # (optional) Executable compiled with pkg
```

## Requirements

- If you use the Node.js script:
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- If you use the `.exe` executable:
  - No requirements
  - The `ffmpeg.exe` and `yt-dlp.exe` binaries must be in the same folder as the script or executable

## Update

To update the project, simply open the `update.exe` executable in the folder. It will automatically fetch the latest available version.

## Usage

### With Node.js

```bash
node maindl.js
```

### With the executable

```bash
./maindl.exe
```

The program will ask you for:

- the YouTube link
- the start timecode (example: `00:00`)
- the end timecode (example: `05:00`)
- the output format:
  - **1**: phone cropped (portrait 9:16)
  - **2**: landscape with blurred sidebars (blur fill)

Then it will produce several files in the same folder, for example:

```
video_temp_part1_portrait.mp4
video_temp_part2_portrait.mp4
video_temp_part1_blurfill.mp4
video_temp_part2_blurfill.mp4
...
```

## Notes

- Videos are cleanly cut with FFmpeg for optimal quality.
- The "blur fill" mode allows you to generate landscape videos suitable for social networks while keeping the full image.
- Automatic TikTok subtitles are not generated by this tool.
- This project is designed for Windows. It can be adapted for Linux/Mac by using the appropriate binaries.
